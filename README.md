# NAPALM: The Non-Aggression Principle Anti-License Mandate

**Current Version:** 2.0 (The "Asset Seizure" Revision)

## About This Mandate

**NAPALM** is not a "software license." It is a **Conditional Title Transfer** designed to operationalize the libertarian ethical framework known as the **Non-Aggression Principle (NAP)** within the realm of scarce resources.

Unlike traditional open-source licenses (GPL, MIT) which rely on State-granted copyright monopolies to enforce compliance, NAPALM relies on **Objective Logic** and **Property Rights**. It treats the software (or resource) as private property that is transferred to you *conditionally*.

### Key Philosophy

NAPALM is derived from the **Axiom of Existence** ($A$ is $A$) and the **Title-Transfer Theory of Contract**.

* **The State** claims jurisdiction over all property, effectively reducing citizens to tenants.

* **NAPALM** rejects this. It asserts that if you initiate force (Aggression), you logically negate your own right to property.

* Therefore, an Aggressor cannot hold valid title to this software.

## Intended Use

This Mandate is for creators who:

* Want to share their work with the peaceful economy.

* **Reject** the legitimacy of Intellectual Property laws.

* Want to ensure their work **never** assists the State, the Military-Industrial Complex, or institutional coercion.

## How It Works (The "Kill-Switch")

1. **Title Transfer:** You are not "licensed" to use the code; you are given *ownership* of a copy, subject to a **Condition Subsequent**.

2. **The Condition:** You must remain a Non-Aggressor.

3. **Automatic Reversion:** The moment you initiate force (e.g., collect taxes, enforce regulations, file a patent lawsuit), the Title reverts to the Author.

4. **Trespass:** Continued use after reversion is not "copyright infringement"—it is **Theft** and **Trespass**.

## Comparison: NAPALM vs. The World

| License | Type | Source Access | Philosophy | Treatment of The State | 
 | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | 
| **NAPALM v2.0** | **Anti-License** | **Open** | **Anarcho-Objectivist** | **Hostile.** State use is "Void Ab Initio" (Theft). | 
| **NAPL v1.1** | Ethical Copyleft | Open | Libertarian | **Restrictive.** Prohibits aggressive acts, but relies on Copyright Law. | 
| **GNU GPLv3** | Strong Copyleft | Open | Software Freedom | **Permissive.** Allows tyranny/military use ("Freedom 0"). | 
| **MIT / BSD** | Permissive | Open | Minimalism | **Permissive.** Corporate/State friendly. | 
| **Proprietary** | Closed | Closed | Profit/Control | **Transaction.** often sells directly to the State. | 

## FAQ

**Q: Is this "Open Source"?**
**A:** No. The Open Source Initiative (OSI) requires that licenses allow *anyone* to use the software, including genocidal dictators. NAPALM is **Ethical Source** or **Strict Scarcity** software. We discriminate against Aggressors.

**Q: Can I sell software under NAPALM?**
**A:** **Yes.** Voluntary exchange is the bedrock of the NAP. You can sell it, fork it, or build businesses on it, provided you do not use the State to enforce your business model.

**Q: I work for the government. Can I use this?**
**A:** **No.**

* **Institutional Use:** If your agency is funded by taxation (theft), it is structurally disqualified from holding title. Any use is **Trespass**.

* **Personal Use (Safe Harbor):** If you are a peaceful individual (e.g., a teacher or firefighter) using it at home for personal projects, you are likely covered by the Safe Harbor clause, provided you don't use it to do your government job.

**Q: Is this compatible with the GPL?**
**A:** **No.** They are mutually exclusive.

* GPL says: "You cannot stop people from using this for war."

* NAPALM says: "You MUST stop people from using this for war."

* **Result:** You cannot distribute a binary containing both. This allows NAPALM to be used as a "poison pill" to brick the distribution of Statist software.

## Evolutionary Diff: NAPL v1.1 vs. NAPALM v2.0

The project has evolved from a standard restrictive license to a weaponized legal instrument.

### 1. Shift in Legal Theory

* **NAPL v1.1:** Relied on **Copyright Law**. It threatened to sue you in a government court for "infringement" if you broke the rules.

* **NAPALM v2.0:** Relies on **Title-Transfer Theory**. It declares that the State has no standing. It enforces via **Repossession**, **Lien**, and **Debt**.

### 2. Definition of "The State"

* **NAPL v1.1:** Implicitly treated the State as a bad actor, but tried to regulate it.

* **NAPALM v2.0:** Explicitly defines the State as a **"Universal Trespasser"**. It creates the "Property Paradox," arguing that the State cannot legally own *anything* because its existence violates property rights.

### 3. Consequences of Violation

* **NAPL v1.1:** "Your rights terminate." (Passive).

* **NAPALM v2.0:** "Automatic Reversion of Title" + **"Restitution Debt"**.

  * The Aggressor now owes the Author a debt payable in **Gold/XMR** at a **100:1 ratio** relative to the damage caused.

  * Establishes a **Permanent Lien** against the Aggressor's personal estate (house, cars, assets).

### 4. Malicious Compliance Features

* **NAPL v1.1:** Simple copyleft.

* **NAPALM v2.0:**

  * **Incompatibility Bomb:** Specifically designed to break GPL dependency chains.

  * **Involuntary Trusteeship:** Any value created by a thief using the software belongs to the Author.

  * **Waiver of Immunity:** Forces bureaucrats to waive "Sovereign Immunity" to use the software.
