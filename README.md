# The Non-Aggression License (NAPL)

## About This License

The Non-Aggression License (NAPL) is a software license designed to bridge the gap between open collaboration and the libertarian ethical framework known as the Non-Aggression Principle (NAP).

Unlike traditional open-source licenses which focus solely on copyright and access to source code, the NAPL introduces a moral condition to the usage of the software. It is a strong copyleft license that ensures software freedom is preserved for peaceful individuals, while strictly prohibiting the software's use for acts of "Aggression" or the initiation of conflict.

### Key Philosophy
The NAPL is built on the Axiom of Individualism. It explicitly rejects the concept of "Group Property" (such as state or collective ownership) and recognizes property rights, including the rights to this software, as residing solely with individuals.

## Intended Use

This license is intended for developers who:
* Want to share their source code freely with the community.
* Believe in strong property rights and voluntary exchange.
* Do not want their software to be used by entities or individuals that initiate force, violence, or theft (e.g., military aggression, unauthorized seizure of property, or coercive state actions).

If you want your code to be free for peaceful people but forbidden to aggressors, the NAPL is designed for you.

## Comparison: NAPL vs. Other Licenses

The NAPL stands apart from both standard Open Source licenses (which allow any use, including violence) and Proprietary EULAs (which restrict use for commercial gain).

| License | Type | Source Access | Copyleft? | Usage Restrictions | Philosophy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NAPL v1.1** | Ethical Copyleft | **Open** | **Yes** | **Strict (Non-Aggression).** Forbidden for aggressors. | Individual Property Rights |
| **GNU GPLv3** | Strong Copyleft | Open | Yes | **None.** "Freedom 0" allows any use (even military). | User Software Freedom |
| **MIT / BSD** | Permissive | Open | No | **None.** Minimal restrictions. | Simplicity & Minimalism |
| **Apache 2.0** | Permissive | Open | No | **None.** Includes patent grants. | Corporate Safety & Collaboration |
| **The Unlicense** | Public Domain | Open | No | **None.** No copyright is claimed. | Total Deregulation |
| **Standard EULA** | Proprietary | **Closed** | N/A | **Strict (Commercial).** Restrictions are arbitrary/financial. | Vendor Control & Profit |

### Why isn't it "Open Source"?
In the strict definition maintained by the Open Source Initiative (OSI), a license cannot discriminate against any person or group, even if that group is doing something objectionable.
* **OSI Licenses (GPL, MIT, Apache)** imply that even a tyrant is allowed to use the software.
* **The NAPL** asserts that a tyrant loses the right to use the software the moment they initiate aggression.

Therefore, the NAPL is better classified as "Ethical Source" or "Source Available" rather than standard Open Source.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I sell software licensed under NAPL?**
**A:** Yes. The license allows for "voluntary exchange." You can sell the software or services related to it, provided the transaction does not involve Aggression (fraud, theft, coercion).

**Q: If I work for a government agency, can I use this?**
**A:** It depends. The license defines "Aggression" as the initiation of conflict against established Property Rights. If your usage involves enforcing collective claims that violate individual property (as defined in Section 2 & 6), your rights to the software are automatically terminated.

**Q: Is this compatible with the GPL, MIT, or Apache?**
**A:**
* **GPL:** No. The GPL forbids additional restrictions.
* **MIT/Apache/BSD:** You can include MIT/Apache code *inside* a NAPL project (since those licenses are permissive), but the resulting combined work must be distributed under the NAPL to maintain the Non-Aggression clause.
